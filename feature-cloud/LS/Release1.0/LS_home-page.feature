      | Responsible Lending: Carefully consider whether a loan is right for your individual financial situation. Borrowing of this type is an expensive form of credit that may be appropriate for short term financial needs but which is not appropriate for longer term borrowing or if you are in financial difficulty. All loan applications are subject to status checks, terms and conditions and to satisfactory passage of checks on credit worthiness and affordability. |
