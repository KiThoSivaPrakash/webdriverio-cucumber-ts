            | Continuous Payment Authority (CPA) is a way of making payments on your loan. It means you give us permission to collect payments automatically from the bank account that's linked to your debit card. This is set up when you apply and can help you avoid missed payments.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
            | You can cancel CPA at any time by asking us or contacting your bank. If you do so, you'll need to arrange payments in a different way, such as online payments via the Lending Stream website, a standing bank order, or even posting a cheque. If your loan payment is outstanding, please contact us so we can help you set something else up.                                                                                                                           |

            | The only fees we charge are for late payments:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
            | The first time you miss a payment, we may apply a late payment charge of up to £15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
            | If you miss any further payments, we may charge you again. The combined amount of all charges we make (including the first one) will not exceed £15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

            | Responsible Lending: Carefully consider whether a loan is right for your individual financial situation. Borrowing of this type is an expensive form of credit that may be appropriate for short term financial needs but which is not appropriate for longer term borrowing or if you are in financial difficulty. All loan applications are subject to status checks, terms and conditions and to satisfactory passage of checks on credit worthiness and affordability. |
