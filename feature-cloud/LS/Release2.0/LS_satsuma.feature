     | Satsuma Loans are relatively short-term loans, which you can apply for online. With a Satsuma Loan, you can apply for up to Â£1,000 as a first time customer, which you can borrow over weekly or monthly repayments for up to a year.                                                                                                                            |
     | If you're approved, it'll take up to an hour to get the money in your account, most of the time. However, if you apply after 11pm, they won't promise hourly payments until the next morning.                                                                                                                                                                    |

     | Satsuma short-term loans are also a sister-brand to Vanquis credit cards, which are credit cards aimed at people with lower credit records. In a similar way to Vanquis being marketed as credit builder cards, some see Satsuma as bad credit loans - however, as with any loan applications, your credit history will form part of the decision.               |
     | Are Lending Stream loans faster than Satsuma Loans?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
     | If you don't have time to wait around for an hour, you might want to try Lending Stream quick loans. We'll give you a quick decision and send the cash to your bank in under 90 seconds if agreed.                                                                                                                                                               |
     | Also, we make it easier for you to be in control of your loan. If you want to repay in your own time, you can do that at any time from your account online. With Satsuma, you need to call them to make further (or early) payments and get a quote on the outstanding amount.                                                                                   |
     | We prefer to give you options. That's why we make it easy for you to repay any time you want. If you'd rather we take the cash using continuous payment authority, we can do that too, so you never have to think about it. But we figured 'what's the point in having an online account and app if you can't make payments through it whenever suits you best?' |
