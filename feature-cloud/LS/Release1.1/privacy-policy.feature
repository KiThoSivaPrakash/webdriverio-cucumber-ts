            | We use automated decision making using your personal information to create a profile of you for credit scoring - a method which predicts your credit worthiness based on your financial profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
            | To carry out credit scoring we use information you give to us, information we obtain from credit reference agencies, and details about how you have used other products and services you have with us. In some cases we will also use external data sources for credit scoring(refer to the Credit Reference Agencies section above). We analyse this information to identify a credit score based on how likely it is that debts will be re-paid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
            | We use credit scoring to make the following decisions about you: whether we enter into a contract to provide a product or service to you; whether to adjust products or services you have to pre-approve any suitable products or services for you; and in some cases where we need to recover a debt from you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

            | We want you to get the most relevant information about products and services at the right time. The most effective way for us to do this is to use automated processes to create a profile of you for marketing. To carry out marketing profiling we use information you give to us, details about how you have used other products and services you have with us and any feedback you have given us, information we have obtained from credit reference agencies, Social networking platforms and information from other companies we are partnering with.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
            | We use processes to analyse this information to decide what products and services to offer to you and to prioritise the marketing messages you receive by assessing your eligibility for those products and services; assessing how likely they are to be useful for you; and deciding how likely you are to respond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
